Yes, the logic using:

```cpp
#ifdef _WIN32
#include <winsock2.h>
#else
#include <arpa/inet.h>
#endif
```

‚úÖ **Will work correctly** for most cross-platform C++ projects.

### üîç Why it works:

* `_WIN32` is defined by all major compilers (e.g., MSVC, GCC, Clang) when compiling for **Windows** ‚Äî regardless of 32-bit or 64-bit targets.
* On **Linux** and **macOS**, `_WIN32` is not defined, so the `#else` branch (`arpa/inet.h`) is included ‚Äî which is standard for POSIX systems.

### üõ†Ô∏è Bonus: Optional safety enhancement

If you want to future-proof or be more explicit, you could do this:

```cpp
#if defined(_WIN32) || defined(_WIN64)
#include <winsock2.h>
#else
#include <arpa/inet.h>
#endif
```

This includes support for both `_WIN32` and `_WIN64`, though in practice `_WIN32` is always defined on Windows, even for 64-bit builds.

### ‚úÖ Conclusion:

Yes, your logic is **correct and portable**. It's a standard approach in C++ for handling OS-specific includes.

Let me know if you also want to use this pattern for functions like `sleep()` or socket initialization (like `WSAStartup()` on Windows).
